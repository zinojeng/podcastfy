Transforming Multimodal Content into Captivating Multilingual Audio Conversations with GenAI

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1559e70-9cf9-4576-b48b-87e7dad1dd0b

Podcastfy is an open-source Python package that transforms multi-modal content (text, images) into engaging, multi-lingual audio conversations using GenAI. Input content include websites, PDFs, youtube videos as well as images.

Unlike UI-based tools focused primarily on note-taking or research synthesis (e.g. NotebookLM ‚ù§Ô∏è), Podcastfy focuses on the programmatic and bespoke generation of engaging, conversational transcripts and audio from a multitude of multi-modal sources enabling customization and scale.
